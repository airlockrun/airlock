# airlock

## Rules

- **Fail loud.** Required dependencies must panic on nil — no silent fallbacks, no optional params, no nil guards that degrade gracefully.
- **Protobuf everywhere.** All REST requests/responses and WebSocket messages use proto-generated types for both input and output.
- **sqlc for queries.** All DB access goes through sqlc-generated code in `db/dbq/`. SQL lives in `db/queries/*.sql`.
- **Capabilities live in `service/{domain}/`, not handlers.** Any operation a user can perform (read, mutate, list — anything authorization or audit cares about) belongs in a `service/{domain}` package. HTTP handlers in `api/` parse the request, build the `authz.Principal`, call the service, and serialize the result; they do not query the DB directly. Sysagent tools, A2A tools, scripts, and tests all hit the same service surface — one capability, one implementation, one gate. Direct `dbq` access from outside `service/` is reserved for narrow read-only lookups that carry no authorization concern (e.g. resolving a slug to an id, fetching a row purely for plumbing).
- **Every service method gates through `authz.Authorize`.** No inline `IsAuthenticatedUser` / `TenantRole.AtLeast` / hand-rolled role checks in service bodies — every gate calls `authz.Authorize(ctx, q, p, Action, agentID)` with an `Action` that lives in `authz/policy.go`. Adding a new capability means adding an `Action` constant + policy-table entry first, then calling `Authorize`. This is what keeps the permission matrix in one editable place; an inline check is invisible to the policy table and creates the drift the table exists to prevent.
- **Keep this file current.** When adding new packages, API endpoints, DB tables, or changing key architecture, update this AGENTS.md to reflect the change.

## Architecture

Airlock is the backend API server — auth, persistence, real-time, container orchestration, and trigger routing.

```
cmd/airlock/       Multi-command binary. Subcommands:
                     - airlock serve              Run the HTTP server
                     - airlock auth unlock <email> [--ip <ip>]
                                                  Clear login lockouts/failures (escape hatch)
                     - airlock auth reset <email>
                                                  Set a one-time temp password (printed
                                                  to stdout); break-glass for a locked-out
                                                  user, including a passkey-only admin.
api/               HTTP handlers (chi router) + WebSocket upgrade
auth/              JWT (HS256), middleware, RBAC (admin/manager/user), bcrypt +
                   zxcvbn password strength (ValidatePasswordStrength), temp-password
                   generation. Claims.MustChangePassword drives the secured-account gate.
auth/passkey/      WebAuthn (go-webauthn) relying-party builder + webauthn.User adapter.
                   RP ID/origin derive from PUBLIC_URL. Ceremonies + storage live in
                   service/passkeys; this is the thin library binding.
auth/lockout/      Per-(email, ip) login throttling — Policy, IP normalization,
                   constant-time response padding for the Login handler.
authz/             The single authorization layer. Principal (registered /
                   anonymous / trigger), EffectiveAgentAccess (the one
                   agent_members resolver), AccessAtLeast (the one ladder
                   ranking), a central Action→Requirement policy map, and
                   Authorize. Every surface (HTTP handlers, bridges, A2A/MCP)
                   builds a Principal and gates through here — no second place
                   decides "what level does this action need".
apperr/            Leaf package: the sentinel errors (ErrForbidden, …), Detail
                   wrapper, and HTTPStatus mapping. service.ErrX are aliases of
                   these so authz can return them without an import cycle.
db/                Postgres — migrations, sqlc queries, connection pool with RLS cleanup
  migrations/      SQL migration files (001_schema.up.sql)
  queries/         sqlc SQL files (agents.sql, messages.sql, etc.)
  dbq/             sqlc-generated Go code (models, queries)
config/            Environment-based config (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, S3_*, ENCRYPTION_KEY, etc.)
builder/           Build pipeline: scaffold → Sol codegen → docker build → deploy
scaffold/          Go project templates (Dockerfile.tmpl, go.mod.tmpl, main.go.tmpl)
container/         Docker container lifecycle (start/stop/health/reap agents + toolservers)
execproxy/         SSH dialer for agentsdk.RegisterExecEndpoint — opens sessions,
                   streams stdout/stderr/exit envelopes back to the agent as
                   NDJSON over chunked transfer encoding. Owns the per-endpoint
                   *ssh.Client cache + host-key TOFU + ED25519 keygen.
trigger/           Dispatcher, Scheduler (cron), BridgeManager, PromptProxy
realtime/          WebSocket Hub + PubSub (in-memory, topic-based with replay buffer)
storage/           S3 client (PutObject, GetObject, presigned URLs) — talks to RustFS
crypto/            AES-256-GCM encryption with key rotation (provider keys, webhook secrets, tokens)
convert/           Type conversion helpers
oauth/             OAuth credential flow management
gen/airlock/v1/    Protobuf-generated Go types (from proto/)
anchor/            Anchor container support
```

## Key Flows

### Agent Build Pipeline
1. `POST /api/v1/agents` → creates agent record (status=draft)
2. Async: scaffold project → Sol codegen in container → `docker build` from `Dockerfile.tmpl` → update `image_ref` → status=active
3. Build events streamed via WebSocket to subscribed clients
4. Agent image tagged as `{agentID}:{commitHash[:12]}`

### Agent Source Synchronization
- Airlock's internal per-agent Git repo is the source served by `HEAD|GET|PUT /api/v1/agents/{id}/source`. The endpoint uses a canonical content hash as an ETag; CLI deploys send `If-Match` so stale workspaces cannot overwrite codegen or another user's deploy.
- `air deploy`, `air pull`, and `air clone` synchronize the canonical source set without requiring external Git. Workspace binding and last-seen state live in `.airlock/local/agent.toml`, which is excluded from source archives.
- Persistent Git bindings have an explicit `read_write` or `read_only` mode. Git is authoritative in both modes. Read/write operations must push before a build succeeds; read-only bindings only pull/rebuild and reject Airlock codegen, source upload, and source rollback. `import_once` is a create action that does not retain a Git binding.
- Every source mutation acquires the per-agent PostgreSQL advisory source lock, including builds/codegen, source uploads, Git clone/pull, and rollback execution.

### Agent Execution
- Agent containers are long-running Docker containers (one per agent, reused if healthy)
- Started on demand via `dispatcher.EnsureRunning()`
- Health checked (3s initial, 15s reuse), reaped after 10min idle — a container with an in-flight request is exempt (the dispatcher brackets every forwarded request with `MarkBusy`/`MarkIdle`), so a run longer than the timeout is never killed mid-execution
- Environment: `AIRLOCK_AGENT_ID`, `AIRLOCK_API_URL`, `AIRLOCK_AGENT_TOKEN`, `AIRLOCK_DB_URL`
- Per-agent DB schema: `agent_{uuid}`
- Libs (`agentsdk/`, `goai/`, `sol/`) injected via `--build-context libs=` from `AGENT_LIBS_PATH`

### Agent Lifecycle States
Runtime state surfaced to the operator is the `(agents.status, container running)` tuple — see `frontend/src/composables/useAgentStatus.ts`:
- **Running**: `status=active` + container up.
- **Suspended**: `status=active` + container down (reaped after idle OR explicitly via `/suspend`). Next trigger auto-resumes via `EnsureRunning`.
- **Stopped**: `status=stopped`. `EnsureRunning` refuses; manual `/start` required.
- **Failed**: `status=failed`. Terminal — needs Upgrade or Rollback.

`/stop` sets status=stopped (no auto-resume); `/suspend` kills the container but leaves status=active (auto-resume on next trigger); `/start` flips stopped→active and starts the container.

### Build Concurrency
All build paths (initial build, manual upgrade, rollback, mass-rebuild) acquire a single shared semaphore inside `builder.Execute`. Default size `max(1, NumCPU/2)`; override via `AIRLOCK_BUILD_PARALLELISM`. The `agent_builds` row is created before the semaphore wait, so a queued build is visible as `status=building` immediately; cancellation while queued is honored via the same ctx that drives the cancel button.

### SDK Bump Mass Rebuild
On startup `builder.RebuildAllOnSDKChange` compares the airlock-bundled `agentsdk.Version` to `system_settings.last_seen_sdk_version`. On drift it iterates every `image_ref != ''` agent (status in active/stopped) and fans out one goroutine per agent calling `Execute(BuildPlan{Kind:upgrade, Instruction:""})` — the shared build semaphore (above) caps concurrency. Failures park the agent: `status=stopped` + `error_message` + container killed. `last_seen_sdk_version` is stamped only after the whole batch completes.

### Message Flow (Web)
1. `POST /agents/{id}/prompt` → upload files to S3 → start container → forward to agent
2. Agent streams NDJSON events (text_delta, tool_call, tool_result, finish)
3. Response stored as assistant message with token counts
4. WebSocket publishes events to subscribed frontend clients

### Trigger System
- **Webhooks**: `POST /webhooks/{agentID}/{path}` → verify (none/hmac/token/bearer/ed25519) → forward to agent
- **Schedules** (crons + dynamic): one unified substrate. `agent_schedule_handlers` holds synced handler defs (`kind` = `cron` | `schedule`); `agent_scheduled_fires` is the due-table a single airlock poller drains every 30s with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (replica-safe; agents stay suspended until a fire is due). `trigger.Scheduler` re-arms recurring crons in-tx (robfig is now a next-time parser only) and `ReconcileAgent` re-seeds cron fires on sync. Fires `POST /fire/{slug}` via `Dispatcher.ForwardFire` (X-Fire-ID header). Agents arm one-shots via `POST /api/agent/schedules` (`ScheduleAt`); the operator cron surface (`ListCrons`/`FireCron`/`CronInfo`) is backed by `kind='cron'` rows.
- **Bridges**: Chat platform integrations (Telegram) — poll for messages, forward via PromptProxy, stream response back

## API Structure

### Public: `/auth`
`POST status|activate|login|refresh|change-password`. `activate` accepts an empty
password (passkey-only first admin). Passkey login: `POST passkey/login/begin|finish`
— begin/finish exchange raw WebAuthn JSON (browser attestation/assertion), not proto;
finish issues the same tokens as password login.

### Authenticated: `/api/v1` (JWT middleware + secured-account gate)
The secured-account gate (`securedAccountGate`) blocks a `MustChangePassword` principal
from everything except `GET /me`, `POST /me/password`, and `POST /me/passkeys/register/*`
until they set a password or register a passkey (then `/auth/refresh` re-reads the cleared
flag and the gate releases).
- **Passkeys**: `GET/POST /me/passkeys`, `register/begin|finish`, rename/delete; `POST/DELETE /me/password` (self-service; raw WebAuthn JSON on the register ceremony, proto elsewhere)
- **Agents**: CRUD + `stop`, `upgrade`, `prompt`, `files`
- **Conversations**: CRUD per agent (one DM per user+agent)
- **Runs**: List, detail, logs (streaming), cancel
- **Webhooks/Crons**: List, manual fire
- **Credentials**: OAuth flow (start/callback), API keys (get/set/revoke/test)
- **Members**: Agent sharing (add/remove users)
- **Providers**: LLM provider config (admin only)
- **Users**: User management (admin only)
- **Bridges**: Chat platform integrations
- **Catalog**: Available providers and models

### Agent Internal: `/api/agent` (agent JWT middleware)
- `PUT connections/{slug}`, `PUT exec-endpoints/{slug}`, `PUT sync` — agent self-registration
- `POST exec/{slug}` — run a command on a registered exec endpoint; airlock streams stdout/stderr/exit envelopes back as NDJSON
- `POST llm/stream` — LLM proxy (optional telescope)
- `POST proxy/{slug}` — credential-injected HTTP proxy
- `PUT|GET|DELETE storage/*` — agent object storage
- `POST seal`, `POST unseal` — encrypt/decrypt on the agent's behalf (the key stays in Airlock). The agent stores the returned ciphertext in its OWN DB, keyed however its domain needs (agent-wide, per-user). Bound to the agent via AAD = agent ID from the JWT, so one agent can't unseal another's. For runtime-generated secrets (e.g. session tokens); plaintext never persists in Airlock.
- `GET|POST|PUT session/{convID}/messages` — conversation history (SessionStore)
- `POST run/complete`, `GET run/{runID}/checkpoint` — run lifecycle
- `POST publish`, `POST|DELETE subscribe` — topic pub/sub

### Webhook Ingress: `/webhooks/{agentID}/{path}` (no auth, verified per-webhook)

### Health: `/health` (no auth)
`GET /health` — 200 + `{status: "ok", db: true, s3: true}` if Postgres + S3 reachable; 503 + `status: "degraded"` with per-subsystem booleans otherwise. For reverse proxies and orchestrator probes.

## Database

Postgres with sqlc. Key tables:
- `tenants`, `users` — single-tenant, RBAC roles
- `providers` — LLM provider catalog (encrypted API keys)
- `agents` — status lifecycle (draft→building→active→failed), config JSONB, build/exec models
- `agent_conversations`, `agent_messages` — DM threads with token tracking
- `agent_webhooks`, `agent_routes`, `agent_topics` (+ `per_user` for personal feeds) — trigger definitions
- `agent_schedule_handlers` (cron+schedule defs, `kind`), `agent_scheduled_fires` (due-table, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` poller) — unified scheduler
- `agent_members` — sharing/permissions
- `connections` — OAuth/API integrations (encrypted credentials)
- `agent_exec_endpoints` — remote command targets (SSH today; transport pluggable). Operator-configured host/port/user + airlock-generated ED25519 keypair (private key in secrets store) + TOFU-pinned host key. Declared by the agent via `RegisterExecEndpoint`.
- `bridges`, `platform_identities` — chat platform integrations (Telegram)
- `runs` — execution history (trigger, status, input/output, timeline)
- `oauth_states` — OAuth flow state tokens
- `auth_failures`, `auth_lockouts` — per-(email, ip) login throttle (see `auth/lockout/`)
- `webauthn_credentials` — registered passkeys (one row per authenticator per user)
- `webauthn_ceremonies` — short-lived, single-use WebAuthn challenge state (begin→finish), GC'd by InboundOAuthGC
- `users.password_hash` is nullable: passkey-only users have no password

## Permission Model

Two independent axes. Don't conflate them.

**Tenant role** — what a user can do *in Airlock as a platform*. Stored on `users.role`, carried in the JWT.
- `admin` — anything (manage users, providers, system settings).
- `manager` — create agents, register bridges, invite members.
- `user` — use agents/bridges they are a member of. No creation rights.

**Agent access** — what a user can do *with a specific agent*. Derived from `agent_members.role` for that (agent, user) pair; non-members fall through to public.
- `admin` — agent owner/co-owner (edit config, add members, manage webhooks/crons).
- `user` — invited member (chat, upload files, fire webhooks they're allowed on).
- `public` — no membership row. Can only reach endpoints explicitly marked `AccessPublic` (e.g. some agent-registered HTTP routes or bridge-level public commands).

Canonical constants: `agentsdk.Access` (`AccessAdmin` / `AccessUser` / `AccessPublic`). Already used for `RouteOpts.Access` on agent-registered custom routes; reuse for any new per-agent permission check (slash commands, etc.) rather than inventing a parallel enum.

Tenant role does **not** grant agent access. A tenant `admin` with no `agent_members` row for agent X has `AccessPublic` on that agent, the same as any other non-member. The only shortcut is that tenant admins can typically add themselves as members; the enforcement still goes through `agent_members`.

## WebSocket

`GET /ws?token=<jwt>` → upgrade → Hub manages connections + topic subscriptions.

Envelope format: `{type, requestId, topicId, payload}`. Topic = agent UUID.

Event types: `subscribe`, `agent.build`, `agent.build.log`, `agent.synced`, `run.text_delta`, `run.tool_call`, `run.tool_result`, `run.confirmation_required`, `run.complete`, `run.error`.

Replay buffer (100 messages) per topic for late subscribers.

## Security

- JWT HS256 tokens: 15min access, 7d refresh. Agent tokens: 100-year.
- Login: passkeys (WebAuthn, phishing-resistant) are primary; a strong password
  (zxcvbn score ≥ 3, enforced identically on the frontend meter) is an optional
  alternative. Passkeys require user verification + resident keys (usernameless
  sign-in). WebAuthn needs HTTPS in production (localhost is exempt for dev); the
  RP ID is the PUBLIC_URL host, so changing that host invalidates enrolled passkeys.
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest for API keys, secrets, tokens. Versioned keys for rotation.
- Webhook verification: none, HMAC, or token-based.
- Agent containers get scoped DB credentials (per-agent schema) and bearer token.
- Agent runtime containers are hardened by default in `container.buildAgentHostConfig` (CapDrop:ALL, no-new-privileges, PidsLimit, lower CPUShares, OomScoreAdj so agents OOM before infra; host-gateway only in dev). Optional `AGENT_MEMORY_LIMIT` and `AGENT_SANDBOX=gvisor` (runsc) — see `docs/agent-isolation.md`.
- **Instance namespacing.** Every Docker resource airlock owns (agent/builder container names, agent image labels, build-cache volumes, buildx builder) is namespaced by `AIRLOCK_INSTANCE_ID` (required; default `airlock`) via the `config.LabelInstance` (`run.airlock.instance`) label. All container/image list+prune calls filter on that label, so instances sharing one Docker daemon never reap each other's resources. **Co-locating instances on one daemon requires a DISTINCT `AIRLOCK_INSTANCE_ID` per instance** plus matching compose namespaces (`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, `DOCKER_NETWORK`, `AGENT_NETWORK`, `AGENT_CODEGEN_VOLUME`); `install.sh --instance-id <id>` writes those together. See `docs/agent-isolation.md`.
- OIDC enterprise support via build tag.

## Key Patterns

- All API types are protobuf-generated from `proto/airlock/v1/` (shared with backend)
- WebSocket subscribes to one agent topic at a time, handles reconnect
- Chat streaming: accumulates `text_delta` events, tracks active tool calls, handles confirmations
- Dark mode via PrimeVue Aura theme + localStorage toggle
- Dev server proxies `/api`, `/auth`, `/ws` to `localhost:8080`

## Build

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # TypeScript check + Vite → dist/
cd frontend && npm run dev      # Dev server with API proxy
```
